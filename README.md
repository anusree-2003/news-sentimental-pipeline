## **📖Overview**

This project is an end-to-end cloud-based pipeline that automates the collection, analysis, and visualization of news sentiment using a fully serverless and containerized architecture on AWS. It fetches real-time news articles from an external API every 5 minutes using Amazon EventBridge to trigger an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function stores raw news data in Amazon S3 and inserts it into Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL). Sentiment analysis is performed locally using TextBlob, and the results are visualized through a Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard is containerized, pushed to Amazon ECR, and deployed via Amazon ECS Fargate. This architecture enables scalable, real-time sentiment tracking of news content with minimal operational overhead.
